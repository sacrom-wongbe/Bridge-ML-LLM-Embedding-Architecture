  "The minimum vertical clearance at the crossing, representing the lowest unobstructed height available for traffic or permitted loads where a special maximum code indicates that no minimum clearance constraint applies.",
  "The minimum vertical clearance available for navigation beneath the structure, representing the limiting height for vessels where a special zero code indicates that navigation clearance is not applicable.",
  "The minimum horizontal clearance available for navigation beneath the structure, representing the limiting width for vessels where a special zero code indicates that navigation clearance is not applicable.",
  "The total horizontal clearance provided through the opening beneath the structure, representing the usable unobstructed width where a special maximum code indicates very large or effectively unrestricted clearance.",
  "The minimum vertical clearance available above the roadway carried on the structure, representing the lowest overhead restriction on the traveled way where a special maximum code indicates no vertical restriction applies.",
  "The minimum vertical clearance available beneath the structure, representing the lowest unobstructed height for the feature passing below the bridge.",
  "The operating load rating capacity of the structure, representing the maximum permissible live load level for continued use where a special zero code indicates the bridge cannot carry a minimum threshold load.",
  "The inventory load rating capacity of the structure, representing the allowable live load level for routine service where a special maximum code indicates live load is negligible due to sufficient cover or fill."
