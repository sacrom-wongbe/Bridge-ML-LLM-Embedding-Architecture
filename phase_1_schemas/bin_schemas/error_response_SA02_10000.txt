    "Low spectral acceleration values below 1.5 indicate minimal seismic demand, suitable for standard design without special seismic considerations.",
    "Moderate values between 1.5 and 2.5 suggest increased seismic demand, requiring enhanced design measures for structural resilience.",
    "High values from 2.5 to 3.5 necessitate robust seismic design strategies, including advanced materials and detailing for ductility.",
    "Very high values between 3.5 and 4.24592825 demand comprehensive seismic analysis and specialized engineering solutions to ensure structural safety.",
    "Extreme values above 4.24592825 indicate severe seismic demand, requiring cutting-edge engineering techniques and materials for maximum structural integrity."
