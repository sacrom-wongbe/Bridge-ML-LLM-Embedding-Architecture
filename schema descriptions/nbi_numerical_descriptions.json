  "The number of years that have elapsed since the bridge was originally constructed, representing its structural age and exposure to long-term deterioration processes.",
  "The total count of traffic lanes carried directly on the bridge deck, reflecting its traffic-carrying capacity and functional role in the roadway network.",
  "The total count of traffic lanes that pass beneath the bridge, indicating the scale and complexity of the facility or corridor being crossed.",
  "The estimated average number of vehicles that cross the bridge per day, representing typical traffic demand and cumulative loading effects.",
  "The clear width of the roadway approaching the bridge, measured in meters, reflecting how traffic is funneled onto the structure.",
  "The number of individual spans that make up the main structural unit of the bridge, indicating structural segmentation and load distribution.",
  "The number of spans in the approach portions of the bridge, representing how the structure transitions between the main unit and adjacent roadway.",
  "The length of the longest individual span in the bridge, reflecting structural scale, span capability, and design demands.",
  "The total longitudinal length of the bridge from end to end, including main and approach spans, representing overall structural extent.",
  "The width of the left-side curb, sidewalk, or shoulder on the bridge, indicating pedestrian accommodation or lateral separation from traffic.",
  "The width of the right-side curb, sidewalk, or shoulder on the bridge, indicating pedestrian accommodation or lateral separation from traffic.",
  "The clear roadway width between curbs or barriers on the bridge deck, representing the usable width available for vehicle traffic.",
  "The total out-to-out width of the bridge deck, including traffic lanes, shoulders, curbs, and barriers, representing the full structural width.",
  "The minimum horizontal clearance available on the right side beneath the bridge, indicating constraints for vehicles or features passing below.",
