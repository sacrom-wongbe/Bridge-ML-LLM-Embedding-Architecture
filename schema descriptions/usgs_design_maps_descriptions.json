  "The design map adjusted maximum expected ground acceleration at the site due to earthquake shaking, reflecting short-period seismic demand that strongly affects stiff structures and foundations.",
  "The mapped short-period spectral acceleration at the site before site soil effects are applied, representing seismic demand on short-period structural components.",
  "The mapped 1.0-second spectral acceleration at the site before site soil effects are applied, representing seismic demand on longer-period structural systems.",
  "The site-adjusted short-period spectral acceleration that accounts for local soil amplification or attenuation of seismic ground motions.",
  "The design-level short-period spectral acceleration used directly in seismic design, reflecting reduced demand consistent with code-defined performance objectives.",
  "The seismic design category that classifies overall seismic risk at the site and governs required detailing, analysis rigor, and design provisions.",
  "The mapped peak ground acceleration associated with maximum considered earthquake conditions prior to any site-specific adjustments.",
  "The peak ground acceleration adjusted for local site conditions, representing the ground motion intensity expected to be experienced at the bridge location."
