[
  "The macro unit name provides the standardized label assigned to a mapped geologic unit, representing a regionally recognized grouping of rock with shared stratigraphic context.",
  "The stratigraphic name identifies the formal stratigraphic unit (such as formation, member, or group) to which the mapped rocks belong, reflecting their position within the geologic column.",
  "The lithology describes the dominant rock material or materials present in the unit, capturing composition and texture that directly influence mechanical and hydraulic behavior.",
  "The minimum geologic age represents the youngest possible time of formation for the unit, expressed in millions of years, constraining when deposition or emplacement ended.",
  "The maximum geologic age represents the oldest possible time of formation for the unit, expressed in millions of years, constraining when deposition or emplacement began.",
  "The descriptive text summarizes the geologic characteristics of the unit, including depositional environment, material variability, structure, and notable features relevant to engineering and geotechnical interpretation."
